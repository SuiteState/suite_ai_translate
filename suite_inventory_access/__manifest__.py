Sales Stock Viewer
==================

Gives sales users read-only access to current on-hand quantities
by location, without granting any Inventory user rights.

A new Sales Stock Viewer group adds a Stock View menu under
Sales -> Products. The view shows current on-hand quantities
grouped by location, with search/filter capabilities.

Optional per-user location restriction lets administrators scope
each sales user to specific warehouse locations. An On Hand
column is also added to the product variants list.

Pure permission layer. No new models, no business logic changes.
Safe to install and uninstall at any time.
